# Contributing Code

High-quality contributions are welcome. Fork the repository and make your changes in a new branch. Once it's ready
for review, create a pull request.

## Authorship

### The Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

Like the Syncthing project, we require the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) sign-off on pull requests (PRs). This
means that all commit messages must contain a signature line to indicate that the developer accepts the DCO.

The DCO is a lightweight way for contributors to certify that they wrote (or otherwise have the right to submit) the code
and changes they are contributing to the project. Here is the full [text of the DCO](https://developercertificate.org):

---

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

1. The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I have the right to submit it under the open source license
   indicated in the file; or

2. The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open
   source license and I have the right under that license to submit that work with modifications, whether created in
   whole or in part by me, under the same open source license (unless I am permitted to submit under a different license),
   as indicated in the file; or

3. The contribution was provided directly to me by some other person who certified (1), (2) or (3) and I have not
   modified it.

4. I understand and agree that this project and the contribution are public and that a record of the contribution
   (including all personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is maintained indefinitely and may be
   redistributed consistent with this project or the open source license(s) involved.

---

Contributors indicate that they adhere to these requirements by adding a `Signed-off-by` line to their commit messages.  
For example:

    This is my commit message

    Signed-off-by: Random T Developer <randomt@example.org>

The name and email address in this line must match those of the committing author.

## Licensing

All contributions are made available under the same license as the already existing material being contributed to. For
most of the project and unless otherwise stated this means MPLv2, but there are exceptions (see [README](./README.md)).

Regardless of the license in effect, you retain the copyright to your contribution.
